## Hi there 👋

My name is Omkar Mehendale, and I am a software engineer currently based in Cincinnati, Ohio. Want to learn more about me? Keep scrolling!

### 🏫 Background

Like I said, I was raised in Cincinnati, and I kept a pretty active lifestyle while growing up, playing any sport I could, such as baseball, soccer, and tennis. I was even a state finalist in doubles! While I was away from sports, I was either hanging out with friends, discovering new hobbies, or simply playing as many video games as I could get my hands on.
