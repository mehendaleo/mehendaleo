## Hi there üëã

My name is Omkar Mehendale, and I am a software engineer currently based in Cincinnati, Ohio. Want to learn more about me? Keep scrolling!

### üè´ Background

I was raised in Cincinnati, and I kept a pretty active lifestyle while growing up, playing any sport I could, such as baseball, soccer, swimming, and tennis. I was even a state finalist in doubles! While I was away from sports, I was either hanging out with friends, discovering new hobbies, or simply playing as many video games as I could get my hands on. 

After high school, I attended THE Ohio State University where I considered a career in medicine, majoring in Psychology and Neuroscience. While I greatly enjoyed my coursework, and really any kind of science, I eventually decided that I didn't actually want a career in medicine. However, I still stay engaged in the field, and do my best to learn as much as possible about scientific progress, or really any interesting development in any field.
